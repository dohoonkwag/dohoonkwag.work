# Why I Built This

Hello and welcome to my blog!

I am just getting started with my career in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). Coming into college, I had about as close to no experience as you can get when it comes to this field. I knew how to program in a few languages, but nothing more than what is covered in the first few weeks of a university introductory computer science course. So, it was a bit of a shock when I came to college and it seemed like everyone was already applying for summer internships and going through interviews. 

What I found during my freshman year is that the advice I got from upperclassmen in CS and ECE was way more helpful than anything I could find online. When I search for career tips online, I get advice like "do a project" or "apply to internships”—which is great, but I always feel like there is limited guidance on *how* to actually start/do these things, especially for those who don’t even know what skills they don’t have. It feels like I’m being shown a very small piece of a large picture.

However, when I talk to upperclassmen who have gone through many of the same struggles (learning to code, applying to internships, failing interviews, etc.), I get to see the whole picture. They’ll say things like, “I tried ______, which didn’t work, so I switched to ______ instead.” or “I had the same problem in my freshman year. Here’s what helped me.” This kind of advice not only feels real and personal, but it has also been the most effective for me. While it’s not coming from an expert, it is coming from someone just a little ahead of me in terms of our careers, and to be completely honest, that makes what they say **so much more** relatable and trustworthy to me. 

Of course, tools like ChatGPT and Google have been super useful to me, but they just can’t replicate or relate to the experiences that my mentors have lived through. Sitting down with someone who’s done what you want to do, and listening to a full story of how they went from a clueless freshman to an intern at Apple is way more impactful to me than a ChatGPT-generated list of tips or a Google search.

The reason I mention this is because I hope that this website can turn into such a resource for other people seeking the same sort of experience-based guidance. I hope that as I continue to write about my experiences (both professional and personal) and what I learn from them, this blog can become a big picture for aspiring Electrical and Computer Engineers, and young people in general, that I think the internet currently lacks.

This website is something I am doing for myself as well. I’ve yet to come across a better technique for learning than teaching what you know to others, so I’m going to solidify what I learn by writing it out on this page! Speaking of writing, I’m pretty bad at it. So I hope that forcing myself to write about my life will turn me into a better writer. With that being said, I wouldn’t expect a grammatically sound blog post for another couple of years.

In the future, there is so much more that this website could become, but I’ll save that for later.
